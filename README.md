#### oh now i write c.

backstory:
had to build llvm from source to get clang and other build tools.
gnu has gcc and stuff but i wanted to get all of em. but yeah...

frontstory:
I CAN NOW WRITE C YIPE!.C is so raw & i like it almost as much as
rust.

might do some more experiments w c here but to run main, just do
`gcc main.c -o whatever && ./whatever`. this repo is just for me,
so you'll never find anything useful here. :)
